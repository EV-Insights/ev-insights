# EV-Insights

## Overview
EV-Insights is a modular and extensible framework designed to analyze, forecast, and manage electric vehicle (EV) charging data. It provides 
tools for DSOs, charging station operators, or private individuals to upload their datasets, either in bulk (if a dataset is already 
available) or as individual tables (if they need to set up a real-time, continuous data import), and ingest them into a centralized 
database, where they can perform detailed analyses of the data ingested, generating statistics such as energy usage, charging session 
durations, and usage patterns, visualized through customizable reports and graphs. Researchers can leverage the framework to work with 
multiple datasets simultaneously, conducting cross-dataset analyses and predictions. Finally, developers can expand the framework by 
introducing new services to address specific needs.
